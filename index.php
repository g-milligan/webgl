    <h1>WebGL Walkthroughs with G2 Milligan</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Milligan. My professional backround is centered around CMS (ecommerce and marketing) but 
        I am inspired by 3D graphics, especially related to <em>game</em> graphics. <br /><br />
        I aspire to create games that, likewise inpire and benefit audiences by incorporating tangential 
        learning into trully imaginative and well-excuted games. <br /><br />
        My goal is to move people and elevate minds. I want to make a vivid connection. <br />
        So this is a starting point; I'm compiling my research on this subject here. <br /><br />
        I started this reference for myself, but if anyone out there can also benefit from my 
        research and tutorial style, then great!</p>
